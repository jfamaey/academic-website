I am an assistant professor at the [Internet and Data Lab](https://idlab.technology) (IDLab), an inter-university research group part of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/idlab/)'s Department of Computer Science and [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en)'s Department of Information Technology. Additionally, I am a principal investigator at [imec](https://www.imec-int.com/).

My general research interests encompass performance modeling and optimization of emerging wireless network technologies. Currently, I am especially interested in low-power wireless networks for the Internet of Things, ultra-reliable low-latency communications for virtual and augmented reality, and the application of smart metasurfaces to beyond 5G wireless networks.
