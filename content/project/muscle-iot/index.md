**Title:** Multimodal Sub-1GHz Communication and Localization for IoT Applications\
**Funding agency:** imec.icon\
**Start date:** April 1, 2017\
**Project duration:** 2 years\
**Website:** <https://www.imec-int.com/en/what-we-offer/research-portfolio/muscle-iot>

The goal of MuSCLe-IoT is to design the necessary algorithms and protocols for both IoT devices and backend systems to support such multimodal communication and localization. Key innovations are planned in terms of inter-technology load balancing and routing, as well as multimodal GPS-less accurate indoor and outdoor localization. Particular attention will be paid to restrict the resulting footprint, signaling overhead and application impact to a bare minimum. A prototype solution will demonstrate the combined use of Sigfox, LoRa, DASH7 and 802.15.4g
