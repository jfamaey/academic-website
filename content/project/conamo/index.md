**Title:** Continous Athlete Monitoring\
**Funding agency:** imec.icon\
**Start date:** October 1, 2016\
**Project duration:** 2 years\
**Website:** <https://www.imec-int.com/en/what-we-offer/research-portfolio/conamo>

The collection and analysis of athlete data in cycling offers a lot of potential to improve cycling experience, training regimes and cycling races strategies. Popular cycling apps gather data, but report and analyze it offline. That is why CONAMO aims to enable the real-time monitoring of athletes. The project will offer a data-driven cycling experience through the development of a mobile network layer for data transmission and an analysis layer that interprets the data gathered in real-time â€“ for instant updates on position and performance that can be vital to training approaches and strategic decision-making during events.
