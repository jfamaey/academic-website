**Title:** Scalable Localization-enabled In-body Terahertz Nanonetwork\
**Funding agency:** European Space Agency (ESA)\
**Start date:** June 1, 2017\
**Project duration:** 2 years

The goal of the SPIDER ESA project is the design of a data link and network layer protocol protocol stack for multi-hop inter-satellite communications in low-earth orbit (LEO) small satellite constellations. The full protocol stack will be implementated and simulated in the ns-3 event-based network simulator.
