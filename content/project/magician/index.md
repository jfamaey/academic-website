**Title:** Mission-Critical Applications Go Into Cellular IoT Networks\
**Funding agency:** imec.icon\
**Start date:** October 1, 2017\
**Project duration:** 2 years\
**Website:** <https://www.imec-int.com/en/what-we-offer/research-portfolio/magician>

The goal of MAGICIaN is to overcome the limitations of out-of-the-box NB-IoT that prevent it from being used for mission-critical applications. Specifically, the standard does not natively support QoS differentiation or seamless handover mechanisms. We will design and develop an end-to-end network management solution that brings QoS guarantees on top of out-of-the-box best-effort NB-IoT networks. The MAGICIaN solution consists of two parts. The network controller interfaces and interacts with the NB-IoT access network (i.e., eNodeBs) and the different components in the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) to bring valueadded services on top of the best effort network.
