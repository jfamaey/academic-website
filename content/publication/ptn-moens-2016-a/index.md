abstract: "The disclosure relates to a computer-implemented method and control system for controlling provisioning of a service in a network. A network function specification data structure of a network function of the service is obtained, wherein the network function specification data structure is associated with at least a first network function implementation, e.g. a physical network function implementation, and a second network function implementation, e.g. a virtual network function implementation, for performing the network function of the service. Network service provisioning is controlled comprising selecting the first network function implementation or the second network function implementation of the network function in the network function specification data structure."
