abstract: "Recent developments in nanotechnology herald nanometer-sized devices expected to bring light to a number of groundbreaking applications. Communication with and among nanodevices will be needed for unlocking the full potential of such applications. As the traditional communication approaches cannot be directly applied in nanocommunication, several alternative paradigms have emerged. Among them, electromagnetic nanocommunication in the terahertz (THz) frequency band is particularly promising, mainly due to the breakthrough of novel materials such as graphene. For this reason, numerous research efforts are nowadays targeting THz band nanocommunication and consequently nanonetworking. As it is expected that these trends will continue in the future, we see it beneficial to summarize the current status in these research domains. In this survey, we therefore aim to provide an overview of the current THz nanocommunication and nanonetworking research. Specifically, we discuss the applications envisioned to be supported by nanonetworks operating in the THz band, together with the requirements that such applications pose on the underlying nanonetworks. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the current contributions on the different layers of the protocol stack, as well as the available channel models and experimentation tools. As the final contribution, we identify a number of open research challenges and outline several potential future research directions."
