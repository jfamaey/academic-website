abstract: "The recent increase of connected devices has triggered countless Internet-of-Things applications to emerge. By using the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4e MAC layer, wireless multi-hop networks enable highly reliable and low-power communication, supporting mission-critical and industrial applications. TSCH uses channel hopping to avoid both external interference and multi-path fading, and a synchronization-based schedule which allows precise bandwidth allocation. Efficient schedule management is crucial when minimizing the delay of a packet to reach its destination. In networks with recurrent sensor data transmissions that repeat after a certain period, current scheduling functions are prone to high latencies by ignoring this recurrent behavior. In this article, we propose a TSCH scheduling function that tackles this minimal-latency recurrent traffic problem. Concretely, this work presents two novel contributions. First, the recurrent traffic problem is defined formally as an Integer Linear Program. Second, we propose the Recurrent Low-Latency Scheduling Function (ReSF) that reserves minimal-latency paths from source to sink and only activates these paths when recurrent traffic is expected. Extensive experimental results show that using ReSF leads to a latency improvement up to 80% compared to state-of-the-art low-latency scheduling functions, with a negligible impact on power consumption of at most 6%."
