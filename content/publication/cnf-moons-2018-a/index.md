abstract: "The Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to different sub-GHz Low Power Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, each having specific characteristics. Today, devices can support multiple LPWAN technologies, picking the best technology depending on application requirements and availability. Realizing such multimodal communication introduces complexity at both the device and network side. In this demo, we show how we can control and manage multimodal LPWA networks by a Virtual Network Operator (VNO) using unified control APIs based on the OMA Lightweight M2M protocol. On top, we demonstrate the use of a single stack across different LPWANs by implementing an adaptation layer between the IP and MAC layer and the feasibility to achieve real multimodal communication."
