abstract: "Low-power wireless mesh networks provide connectivity for a wide range of applications in industrial scenarios. For many years, IEEE 802.15.4e Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) networks have proven their efficiency in such environments, providing high reliability and low-power operation. TSCH networks run on top of one physical (PHY) layer and are thus limited by the characteristics of the chosen PHY layer in terms of, among others, data rate, reliability and energy efficiency. To tackle these limitations and to improve network performance and flexibility in those challenging industrial environments, this work explores the simultaneous use of multiple PHYs, and more specifically multiple modulation and coding schemes (MCSs), in a TSCH network. Traditionally, TSCH relies on fixed-duration slots, large enough to send a packet of any size given the fixed data rate. In order to avoid wasting airtime when simultaneously using multiple PHYs or MCSs with different data rates, we first introduce the concept of slot bonding. This allows the creation of different-sized bonded slots with a duration adapted to the data rate of each chosen PHY. Afterwards, we formally describe TSCH slot bonding using a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) model. Finally, we use this model to determine the optimal MCS configuration with a short slot frame length that causes network saturation and show the scalability advantage of slot bonding in terms of packet delivery ratio."
