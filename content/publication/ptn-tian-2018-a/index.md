abstract: "The invention pertains to a method for determining transmission parameters in a wireless local area network operating under a restricted access window scheme, said wireless local area network comprising an access point and a plurality of stations, the method comprising at said access point: estimating respective transmission intervals and next transmission times of said plurality of stations; and assigning a subset of said plurality of stations to a restricted access window group on the basis of said estimated next transmission times. The invention also pertains to a computer program product comprising code means configured to cause a processor to carry out the method and an access point configured to carry out the method."
