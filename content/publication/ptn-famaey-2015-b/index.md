abstract: "The invention relates to a method, a system and various components of such a system for selecting a chunk identifier in a content delivery network. In said network a first and a second chunk are available, belonging to different quality representations of a content item. A client device transmits a first chunk retrieval request for retrieving a first chunk and a further request. In response to said first chunk retrieval request and/or said further request, delivery path information is transmitted. The delivery path information may comprise chunk identifiers and bandwidth indicators. On the basis of the delivery path information the client device determines a chunk identifier to be included in a second chunk retrieval request for retrieving a second chunk."
