abstract: "A variety of nanoscale applications require downlink and broadcast-based transmission of control packets from a powered transmitter to energy-harvesting nanonodes with constrained storage capacity. The nanonode's communication system is anticipated to be a bottleneck for such nanonetworks, hence an accurate modeling of its energy consumption is needed. Currently, TS-OOK is a prevailing scheme for nanocommunication in the terahertz (THz) frequencies, with short pulses representing logical 1s and silences logical 0s. In the energy modeling of this scheme, certain energy consumptions are attributed to the transmission and reception of the pulses. However, traditional communication systems teach us that the idling energy consumption should not be neglected. Hence, we provide an energy consumption model for TS-OOK-based nanocommunication systems that accounts for the energy consumed in idling, in addition to the transmission and reception-originated consumptions. We demonstrate that, for a meaningful performance of the considered nanonetwork, the nanonode's idling energy consumption has to be at least nine orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding energy consumption in reception. To increase the tolerable idling energy, we propose a new energy lifecycle for the receiving nanonodes. Assuming frequent packet repetitions on the transmit side, the proposed lifecycle utilizes periodic short wake-ups of the receiving nanonodes. We show that, when the proposed lifecycle is utilized, up to three orders of magnitude higher idling energy consumption can be tolerated compared to the baseline."
