abstract: "A method and system for enabling a plurality of adaptive streaming client devices to share network resources includes a network node monitoring chunk request messages of client devices configured to select a quality level of a chunk from a plurality of quality levels and to request a media server for transmission of a chunk of the selected quality level. The quality level in a monitored chunk request message of a client device is used to estimate local quality information associated with the quality performance of the client device. Global quality information, determined based on the estimated local quality information associated with the client devices, and being indicative of the global quality performance of the client devices, is sent to the client devices. The client devices are configured for selecting a quality level for a subsequent chunk based on the global quality information and based on local quality information determined by the client during or after rendering media data of a requested chunk such that deviations between the global quality information and the local quality information is minimized."
