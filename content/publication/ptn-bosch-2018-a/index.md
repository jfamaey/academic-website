abstract: "A method is disclosed for providing network access by a network stack in a communication device comprising a plurality of physical communication interfaces, each comprising a data link layer for the exchange of data frames with remote communication devices and a data link layer interface for exchanging data of data frames between the data link layer and higher layers in the network stack; and wherein the method comprises i) providing an abstraction data link layer comprising a single abstracted data link layer interface such that the plurality of physical communication interfaces appear as a single data link layer interface to the higher layers; and ii) obtaining network packets from the higher layers and distributing the network packets over the plurality of physical communication interfaces according to a neutral packet distribution scheme."
