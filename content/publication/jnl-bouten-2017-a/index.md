abstract: "Network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) have been proposed to increase the cost-efficiency, flexibility, and innovation in network service provisioning. This is achieved by leveraging IT virtualization techniques and combining them with programmable networks. By doing so, NFV and SDN are able to decouple the network functionality from the physical devices on which they are deployed. Service function chains (SFCs) composed out of virtual network functions (VNFs) can now be deployed on top of the virtualized infrastructure to create new value-added services. Current NFV approaches are limited to mapping the different VNF to the physical substrate subject to resource capacity constraints. They do not provide the possibility to define location requirements with a certain granularity and constraints on the colocation of VNF and virtual edges. Nevertheless, many scenarios can be envisioned in which a service provider (SP) would like to attach placement constraints for efficiency, resilience, legislative, privacy, and economic reasons. Therefore, we propose a set of affinity and anti-affinity constraints, which can be used by SP to define such placement restrictions. Furthermore, a semantic SFC validation framework is proposed that allows the virtual network function infrastructure provider (VNFInP) to check the validity of a set of constraints and provide feedback to the SPs. This allows the VNFInP to filter out any non-valid SFC requests before sending them to the mapping algorithm, significantly reducing the mapping time."
