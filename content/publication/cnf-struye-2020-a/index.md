abstract: "The need for cables with high-fidelity Virtual Reality (VR) headsets remains a stumbling block on the path toward interactive multi-user VR. Due to strict latency constraints, designing fully wireless headsets is challenging, with the few commercially available solutions being expensive. These solutions use proprietary millimeter wave (mmWave) communications technologies, as extremely high frequencies are needed to meet the throughput and latency requirements of VR applications. In this work, we investigate whether such a system could be built using specification-compliant IEEE 802.11ad hardware, which would significantly reduce the cost of wireless mmWave VR solutions. We present a theoretical framework to calculate attainable live VR video bitrates for different IEEE 802.11ad channel access methods, using 1 or more head-mounted displays connected to a single Access Point (AP). Using the ns-3 simulator, we validate our theoretical framework, and demonstrate that an IEEE 802.11ad AP can support at least 8 headsets receiving a 4K video stream for each eye, with transmission latency under 1 millisecond."
