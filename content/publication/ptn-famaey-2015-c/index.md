abstract: "A method for providing chunked content to a device having a streaming client, chunked content defined on the basis of a manifest file having chunk identifiers and associated chunk locators for locating delivery nodes configured to deliver chunks identified by the chunk identifiers. Whether a chunk identified by a chunk identifier in a chunk request message originating from the client can be delivered by a first delivery node is determined, the request message including a first network address associated with the first node. If the first node cannot deliver the chunk to the client, the first address is rewritten into a second network address associated with a delivery node capable of delivering the chunk before sending the request message to the second node. Before sending a chunk response message associated with the request message to the client, the second address in the response message is rewritten into the first address."
