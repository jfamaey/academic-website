abstract: "The current local area networks (LANs) are occupied by a large variety of heterogeneous consumer devices, equipped with the ability to connect to the Internet using a variety of different network technologies (e.g., Ethernet, 2.4 and 5GHz Wi-Fi). Nevertheless, devices generally opt to statically connect using a single technology, based on predefined priorities. This static behaviour does not allow the network to unlock its full potential, which becomes increasingly more important as the requirements of services, in terms of latency and throughput, grow. In this paper we present a real-life SDN-based implementation of our previously proposed algorithm that addresses this problem."
