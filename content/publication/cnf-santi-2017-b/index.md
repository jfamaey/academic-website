abstract: "IEEE802.11ah is a new Wi-Fi standard aiming to provide long-range connectivity to densely deployed power-constrained station. In this abstract, we present an extension to the IEEE 802.11ah restricted access window (RAW) implementation in ns-3 to enable proper state transitions to and from sleep mode. This in turn enables accurate energy consumption modeling of this new technology. A comparison of RAW and CSMA/CA in terms of energy effciency is provided, showing that RAW is considerably more energy effcient, due to shorter back-off periods."
