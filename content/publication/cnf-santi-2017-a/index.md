abstract: "IEEE 802.11ah is a new Wi-Fi standard operating on unlicensed sub-GHz frequencies. It aims to provide long-range connectivity to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The IEEE 802.11ah restricted access window (RAW) mechanism promises to increase throughput and energy efficiency in dense deployments by dividing stations into different RAW groups and allowing only one group to access the channel at a time. In this demo, we demonstrate the ability of the RAW mechanism to support a large number of densely deployed IoT stations with heterogeneous traffic requirements. Differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) is offered to a small set of high-throughput wireless cameras that coexist with thousands of best-effort sensor monitoring stations. The results are visualized in near real-time using our own developed IEEE 802.11ah visualizer running on top of the ns-3 event-based network simulator."
