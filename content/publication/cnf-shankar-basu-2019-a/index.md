abstract: "Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is gaining prominence as a key Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology for IoT applications. Since it operates on licensed frequency spectrum it can provide guarantees to applications demanding Quality of Service (QoS). NB-IoT has emerged as a competitive rival for other LPWAN technologies such as LoRa and Sigfox, which work in the unlicensed frequency spectrum and are vulnerable to interference. Therefore, NB-IoT is the trivial fit for industries and other business companies that demand guaranteed services. In this paper the different features of the NB-IoT technology have been studied on the commercial Orange network in Belgium using the ublox SARA-N210 module as the user equipment (UE). We focused on the device and network performance in terms of setup times, signal quality, throughput, latency, and reliability and studied the network dynamicity on signal strength. These observations are then compared with the theoretical defined limits of NB-IoT."
