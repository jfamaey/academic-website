abstract: "Today's electronic devices have multiple communication technologies available at any time. Currently, the application layer or the user needs to manually switch between them, depending on the networks in range. No holistic and adaptive approach exists that can manage all technologies and devices at once. To this extent, we previously proposed the inter-technology management framework ORCHESTRA. The framework is the first of its kind in providing fine-grained packet-level control across different network technologies in a network-wide manner. In this paper, we present a real-life implementation of this framework and show that it can cope well with mobility requirements of users by offering seamless inter-technology handovers."
